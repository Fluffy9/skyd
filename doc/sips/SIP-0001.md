# SIP1 - Merklized Data Machine

SIP1 is a description of a virtual machine - the Merklized Data Machine (MDM) -
that executes instructions on the data in a Sia file contract. The file contract
tracks the size and Merkle root of the underlying data, and each instruction of
the MDM will access or modify the data in some way. Each instruction can
optionally produce a cryptographic proof that the instruction was executed
honestly. Every instruction has a computable cost, and instructions can be
batched into atomic sets that are either entirely applied or not applied at all.
A batch is called a program.

## Machine Specification

The Merklized Data Machine (MDM) is a virtual machine on a host that performs
operations on the data in a Sia file contract. The data in the contract is
tracked by a size and a Merkle root. The Sia consensus protocol breaks the
contract data into 64 byte 'segments', where each segment is a leaf of the
Merkle tree that builds into the Merkle root. The MDM operates on this data.

### Sectors

The MDM breaks the contract data into 4 MiB 'sectors'. A sector's Merkle root
can be computed by treating each of the 65,536 segments as a leaf in a Merkle
tree and combining them into the root. Because the sector root is computed using
the same leaves as the contract Merkle root, the sector roots can themselves be
used to compute the contract Merkle root. The MDM requires that the contract
size be a multiple of the sector size.

The host is explicitly expected to store all data within a sector continuously
on disk. Other than this requirement, contract data is not expected to be stored
continuously.

The host maintains a global lookup table that maps from each sector root to the
location on disk where the data is stored. This allows users to query data by
its Merkle root, even if the user does not know which contract is responsible
for maintaining the data. The global lookup table also maps from a sector root
to the contract that stores the sector and to the index within the contract
where the sector currently resides, allowing the owner of a sector to modify the
sector without needing to know it's location within the contract. This global
mapping gets updated any time that the data in a contract is altered.

### Programs

The MDM has 'instructions' that can be executed, each instruction performing a
distinct operation on the data. Every instruction starts with an initial Merkle
root and size and produces an updated Merkle root and size. Instructions can
produce output data to be sent to the caller, and optionally also a Merkle proof
that the update was performed correctly.

Instructions are batched together into 'programs'. The first instruction takes
the contract Merkle root and size as its state input, and then passes the
updated Merkle root and size to the next instruction. The final instruction
passes the final Merkle root and size to the user.

### Program Data

The program has a data field. The data field is generally used for large inputs,
for example if an instruction is being used to write a whole sector, the write
data will be in the data field. The operands of the write instruction will
indicate where to look in the data field for the write data.

Instructions are allowed to modify the data field. The modifications will be
visible to future instructions, meaning that the data field can be used to
communicate information across instructions.

The size of the data field cannot be changed by an instruction.

### Tracking Resource Consumption

Each instruction has an associated cost which roughly attempts to mirror the
actual cost of performing the instruction to the host. The cost is a measurement
of the 4 following resources:

* Disk Accesses
* Disk Reads
* Disk Writes
* Compute Power

The cost of an instruction is required to be computable using nothing but the
starting contract size and the operands of the instruction. The cost must not be
dependent on the program data nor any other external information. The same is
true for the size of the contract - the final size of the contract data must be
computable using nothing more than starting size and the instruction operands.

Because the cost of each instruction can be computed based on the operands
alone, the cost of a program can also be computed by adding up the cost of each
individual instruction run in the program. And because the contract size can be
updated using nothing more than each instruction's operands, the final size of
the contract can be computed by pre-computing the output size of each
instruction run in the program, and then taking the final output size from the
final instruction.

Instantiating the MDM has the following costs:

* Disk Access:   1 accesses
* Disk Read:     0 bytes
* Disk Write:    0 bytes
* Compute Power: 1 unit

### Interruption

A program being executed can be interrupted. If an interrupt signal is received,
the host will attempt to abort the program, reverting all changes and accepting
the interrupt. It may be the case that an interrupt is received after a program
has been fully comitted, and can no longer be reverted. If this happens, the
host will reject the interrupt. Rejecting the interrupt is not an error, both
acceptance and rejection of an interrupt are considered successful calls. The
full cost of the program will be applied even if the program is interrupted
early.

### Errors

If any instruction returns an error, the entire program is aborted. The user is
still charged for the resources cost of the program, and the user is fed the
program error, along with an index indicating which instruction failed.

## Program Format

The MDM is always called using program at a time.

```go
type MerkleRoot crypto.Hash

type MerkleProof []crypto.Hash

// InstructionSerialization contains a generic instruction serialized for the
// MDM. The OpCode indicates which instruction should be used. The operands are
// all of the information required to compute the cost of executing the
// instruction and the resulting size of the contract data.
//
// The operands are required to be under 4 kib total, any larger inputs need to
// be placed in the program data.
type InstructionInfo struct {
	OpCode        types.Specifier
	Operands      []byte
	ProofRequired bool
}

// Instruction defines the set of methods required to build, cost, and execute
// an instruction within the MDM. The instruction itself should be stateless,
// all required inputs are provided in the interface.
type Instruction interface {
	// The initialSize and the inputs should be the only information required to
	// compute the cost of executing the instruction and the resulting size of
	// the file.
	//
	// Size is necessary to compute in advance for two reasons. The first is
	// that in some cases, for example with proof generation, the size can have
	// an impact on the final cost. The second is that the host needs to be able
	// to tell if there is enough disk space available to execute all of the
	// instructions.
	CostAndSize(initialSize uint64, proofRequired bool, operands []byte) (*MDMCost, uint64)

	// The instruction is executed on file 'f', mutating the state of 'f' in a
	// way that can be reverted if a future instruction in the batch fails. If
	// the instruction has no output, 'output' will be nil even for a successful
	// execution. If no proof is requested, 'proof' will be 'nil' even for a
	// successful execution.
	//
	// Execute is allowed to modify the programData, the changes will be visible
	// to all future instructions.
	Execute(env *environment, operands []byte, proofRequired bool, programData []byte) (output []byte, proof []byte, err error)
}

// Authorization of the program is assumed to have already happened by the time
// the MDM is initialized.
type Program struct {
	Code []InstructionInfo
	Data []byte
}

// When a program has terminated, this data is sent to the user.
type ProgramOutput struct {
	FinalMerkleRoot MerkleRoot
	FinalSize       uint64

	// These slices are the same size as the input slices, one element per
	// instruction. Some of the elements of each slice may be 'nil' if there is
	// no ouptut or proof for that instruction.
	//
	// Each proof should enable a verifier to chain a previous intermediate
	// merkle root to an updated intermediate Merkle root. The very first
	// intermediate root is the starting root of the file contract, and the
	// final intermediate root should match the FinalMerkleRoot of the program 
	// output.
	InstructionOutputs [][]byte
	InstructionProofs  []MerkleProof
}

// The MDMCost is the cost of executing an MDM instruction or program.
type MDMCost struct {
	DiskAccesses uint64
	DiskReads    uint64
	DiskWrites   uint64
	ComputePower uint64
}

// Add will add the costs of x and y together, placing the result in z and
// returning z.
func (z *MDMCost) Add(x, y *MDMCost) *MDMCost {
	z.DiskAccesses = x.DiskAccesses + y.DiskAccesses
	z.DiskReads = x.DiskReads + y.DiskReads
	z.DiskWrites = x.DiskWrites + y.DiskWrites
	z.ComputePower = x.ComputerPower + y.ComputePower
	return z
}

// CostAndSize reports the cost of executing a program and the resulting size of
// the file from executing the program.
//
// The size following the execution of a program is needed so that the host can
// verify before execution that there is enough space available.
func (p *Program) CostAndSize() MDMCost {
	totalCost := new(MDMCost)
	size := initialSize
	for _, ii := range bi.Instructions {
		i := getInstruction(ii.OpCode) // Fetches the instruction object associated with the instruction name.
		newCost, newSize := i.CostAndSize(size, i.Inputs, i.ProofRequired)
		size = newSize
		totalCost.Add(totalCost, newCost)
	}
	c.ComputePower++ // Cost of initializing a batch of instructions.
	return c, size
}

func (p *Program) Execute(env *environment) (ProgramOutput, error) {
	var po ProgramOutput
	for _, ii := rangebi.Instructions {
		i := getInstruction(ii.OpCode)
		iOutput, iProof, err := i.Execute(env, ii.Operands, ii.ProofRequired, p.Data)
		if err != nil {
			return ProgramOutput{}, err
		}
		po.InstructionOutputs = append(po.InstructionOutputs, iOutput)
		po.InstructionProofs = append(po.InstructionProofs, iProof)
	}
	env.commit()
	return ProgramOutput, nil
}
```

The MDM is always instantiated with a list of instructions followed by a list
inputs for each instruction.

## Supported Instructions

Notation: the instructions are written as functions that take multiple variables
as input. The variables are assumed to have an obvious encoding into the
operands. If instruction requires an interaction with the program data, the
variable will be prefixed by 'pd'. If the instruction writes to the program
data, the destination will be a []byte prefixed by 'wpd'. The operands will also
need to include information about where to find the 'pd' and 'wpd' variables
within the program data.

If the instruction has data output that is sent to the user, the instruction
definition will return a []byte.

TODO: Formal specification for encoding instruction inputs into operands.

### Read(offset, length uint64) []byte

Read will read 'length' bytes from the contract, starting from the provided
offset. The request must exist fully within the bounds of the contract.

The output of Read is the 'length' bytes that appear in the contract starting
from the provided offset.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    2 + (length / sectorSize)
* Disk Read:        length
* Disk Write:       0
* Computation Cost: log2(contractSize/64)

### ReadSector(root crypto.Hash, offset, length uint64) []byte

ReadSector will read data from the sector with the sector root 'root'.
ReadSector will read 'length' bytes from the sector starting from the provided
offset. The request must exist fully within the bounds of the sector.

The output of ReadSector is the 'length' bytes that appear in the sector
starting from the provided offset.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    1
* Disk Read:        length
* Disk Write:       0
* Computation Cost: log2(contractSize/64)

### Write(offset uint64, pdData []byte)

Write will write 'pdData' at offset 'offset' within the contract, overwriting
any data that already exists at that location. Write must not go beyond the
bounds of the existing file contract data.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    2 + (len(pdData) / sectorSize)
* Disk Read:        0
* Disk Write:       len(pdData)
* Computation Cost: log2(contractSize/64)

### WriteSector(root crypto.Hash, offset uint64, pdData []byte)

Write will write 'pdData' at offset 'offset' within the sector, overwriting any
data that already exists at that location. Write must not go beyond the bounds
of the sector.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    1
* Disk Read:        len(pdData)
* Disk Write:       0
* Computation Cost: log2(contractSize/64)

### Copy(size, destOffset, sourceOffset uint64)

Copy will copy the data from sourceOffset to destOffset, overwriting existing
data. Copy cannot copy outside the boundary of the existing file contract.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    4 + 2 * (size / sectorSize)
* Disk Read:        size
* Disk Write:       size
* Computation Cost: 2 * log2(contractSize/64)

### CopySector(size, destOffset, sourceOffset uint64, destRoot, sourceRoot crypto.Hash)

CopySector will copy data from the sourceRoot at the sourceOffset to the
destRoot at the destOffset. The copy is not allowed to go outside the range of
either sector.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    2
* Disk Read:        size
* Disk Write:       size
* Computation Cost: 2 * log2(contractSize/64)

### Swap(size, offset1, offset2 uint64)

Swap will read data from offset1, then read data from offset2, then write the
data from offset1 to offset2, then write the data from offset2 to offset1.

TODO: Should the offsets be allowed to overlap? Probably not.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    4 + 2 * (size / sectorSize)
* Disk Read:        size
* Disk Write:       size
* Computation Cost: 2 * log2(contractSize/64)

### Truncate(newSize uint64)

Truncate will change the size of the contract data to be equal to the newSize,
throwing away data on the tail of the file if the new size is smaller, and
appending zeroes to the end of the contract data if the new size is larger. If
newSize is equal to the current size of the contract data, this instruction is a
no-op.

'newSize' must be a multiple of the sectorSize.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    1
* Disk Read:        0
* Disk Write:       0
* Computation Cost: log2(contractSize/64)

### RenewContract()

TODO: This operation has extra overheads + costs, not sure how to handle that.
We need Renew to be inside of the MDM because the new file contract needs to be
created atomically with dropping garbage sectors. The renew operation also needs
to zero out the data in the previous contract / previous revision, and that
needs to happen in a single transaction.

Cost:
* Disk Accesses:    1
* Disk Read:        0
* Disk Write:       0
* Computation Cost: log2(contractSize/64)

## Example Programs

### Delete A Sector

This program deletes sector 7 from a contract with 250 sectors, where the final
49 sectors are garbage. Metadata in the leading sector needs to be updated to
indicate the new length of the garbage.

Instructions {
	Swap(2^22, 7*2^22, 200*2^22)
	Write(4096, payload[:4096])
}

### TODO: Write a similar program as above

except read from the metadata to know where the swap should happen. This may
result in the swap operands being modified - the size needs to be an operand,
but offset1 and offset2 could actually be payload variables. Another instruction
could read from the metadata and then modify the payload to tell swap how to
swap out the garbage.

### Renew a File Contract with Garbage

This program renews a file contract that has 250 sectors, but the final 50
sectors are garbage.

Instructions {
	Truncate(200*2^22)
	Renew()
}

### TODO:

Write some program that relates to updating multiple contracts simultanously,
preserving ACID properties. Or maybe some program that would be related /
necessary to doing continuous backup.

### TODO:

Write some program related to filesystem trasversal, such that the renter can
read data without needing multiple round trips.
