- Add support for uploading entire directories as skyfiles (e.g. `siac skynet upload dir skyfile_name`). The previous behavior of uploading all files individually is now available when the `--separately` flag is passed. Additional flags: `--defaultpath` and `--disabledefaultpath`. Those are full equivalents to the flags with the same names on the `/skynet/skyfile/*siapath* [POST]` endpoint.
